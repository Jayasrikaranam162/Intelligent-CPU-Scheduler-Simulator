# Intelligent-CPU-Scheduler-Simulator
A Java-based simulator for visualizing CPU scheduling algorithms (FCFS, SJF, RR, Priority). Features include Gantt chart, performance metrics, interactive GUI, and data saving. Designed for educational use to bridge theory and practical understanding in OS concepts.

Features
1) Supports Multiple Algorithms: FCFS, SJF (Non-preemptive), Round Robin, and Priority Scheduling.
2) Real-Time Gantt Chart: Visual representation of process execution.
3) Performance Metrics: Calculates average waiting time, turnaround time, and response time.
4) Interactive GUI: Built with JavaFX/Swing for seamless user interaction.
5) Data Persistence: Save and load simulations.

Technologies Used
1) Java, JavaFX/Swing
2) JFreeChart/Matplotlib for graphs
3) JUnit for testing
